# nintenDont
A cute little script that I whipped up one evening that can be used to kick Nintendo DS users off of a local wireless game in progress.

##Notes
Requires pcregrep and the aireplay-ng to run. 
Any statements that are surrounded by DEBUG can be commented out in use as they are just for my dev sanity.

##Side Effects
Will also do the same for any WPA encrypted networks in the area that have a hidden SSID
